sta.spatial.region

* needs a spatial reference frame (origo, coordinate axes, units)
* can have a spatial data structure
* can contain geometry objects

Function prototype: functionName (parameter(s)) : return type
    * Distance(geometry, geometry) : number
    * Equals(geometry, geometry) : boolean
    * Disjoint(geometry, geometry) : boolean
    * Intersects(geometry, geometry) : boolean
    * Touches(geometry, geometry) : boolean
    * Crosses(geometry, geometry) : boolean
    * Overlaps(geometry, geometry) : boolean
    * Contains(geometry, geometry) : boolean
    * Length(geometry) : number
    * Area(geometry) : number
    * Centroid(geometry) : geometry


    * Spatial Measurements: Finds the distance between points, polygon area, etc.
    * Spatial Functions: Modify existing features to create new ones, for example by providing a buffer around them, intersecting features, etc.
    * Spatial Predicates: Allows true/false queries such as 'is there a residence located within a mile of the area we are planning to build the landfill?'
    * Constructor Functions: Creates new features with an SQL query specifying the vertices (points of nodes) which can make up lines. If the first and last vertex of a line are identical the feature can also be of the type polygon (a closed line).
    * Observer Functions: Queries which return specific information about a feature such as the location of the center of a circle

Tree datastructures

* with pointers
* in an array
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap


Thin classes as easy-to-use interface to the underlying field datastructures.

Test-driven cases...
