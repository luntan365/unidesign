unidesign.spatial.geometry
--------------------------
How to accomodate different data structures?

.region
* can have a spatial data structure
* can contain geometry objects

.group
A compound of a set of basic and advanced geometric objects
e.g. "neuron": trees, cellbody, spines, synapses, vesicles, other
subcellular components etc. This helps for de/selecting

vs. a group of different object types (tree, slices etc.)
vs. can group anything, give it a new group id
storage in NeuroHDF with a list of paths?
