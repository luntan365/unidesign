"An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for
it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence
we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances,
though still numerically identical with them).
A perdurantist on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through
time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we
consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its
"temporal parts" or instances of existing. "

Spike Train Metric

spike distance metric to evaluate each neuron’s spike discharge pattern. The metric quantifies the distance between
every possible pair of spike trains in the data set for each neuron.
